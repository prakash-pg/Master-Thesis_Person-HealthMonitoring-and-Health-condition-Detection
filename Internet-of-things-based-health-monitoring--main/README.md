# Internet-of-things-based-health-monitoring-

This Project involves developing an Internet of Things based health monitoring system that utilizes
various sensors to monitor the real-time health of patients. The system measures vital signs such as
heart rate, blood oxygen, body temperature, room temperature, room humidity, and air quality using an
ESP32 microcontroller. The collected data is transmitted to the cloud via our custom-built website for
remote monitoring by health care professionals. Additionally, the system is designed to automatically
send SMS notifications to doctors in emergency situations using IFTTT. The collected data is analyzed
using various machine learning algorithms to detect any abnormalities in the person's health condition,
enabling accurate and timely interventions.
